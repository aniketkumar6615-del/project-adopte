# AdaptoWeb Browser Extension

AdaptoWeb is a comprehensive browser extension designed to provide real-time adaptive web interfaces for users with cognitive and learning disabilities (CLDs), including ADHD and dyslexia. The extension transforms standard webpages on the client side to reduce cognitive load, improve task efficiency, and enhance user autonomy.

## üéØ Key Features

### Layout Simplification
- **Content Extraction**: Automatically identifies and extracts main content using DOM traversal and scoring heuristics
- **Distraction Removal**: Removes or hides advertisements, sidebars, pop-ups, auto-playing videos, and social media widgets
- **Clean Formatting**: Applies single-column layout with increased font size and line spacing for improved readability

### Language Simplification
- **AI-Powered Text Simplification**: Uses client-side NLP models to simplify sentence structure and vocabulary while preserving meaning
- **Original Text Preservation**: Maintains original text in data attributes with hover tooltips for reference
- **Adaptive Processing**: Processes text nodes in real-time as content loads

### Interaction Guidance
- **Complex Form Detection**: Identifies multi-step forms and complex interactions
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Groups related form fields into logical steps with guided navigation
- **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Provides clear, sequential guidance through complex processes

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Extension Components
